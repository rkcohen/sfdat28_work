##Project Question Ideas
  
1. I'm planning on predicting restaurant/food trends using social media data.
  * I am planning on getting my data from the Instagram and Yelp APIs.
  * I know that both data sets have geolocation tagging, which will be able to serve as a common column in the data sets.
  * I chose this topic because I am interested in the relationship that social media has with emerging food trends in major metropolitan areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York.
2. Can we predict where a bike is going based on time/location of the rental transaction?
  * I am planning on getting my data from the city of Chicago open data sets (divvybikes).
  * The data set has 62M events (rows) and 14 features, including a time and geolocation stamp. It also contains dock statistics.
  * I chose this topic because analyzing data from a point to point 'check-in'  service seems like an interesting study of emergent properties.
3. Can we learn anything about the basketball "meta" (current state of the game) by analyzing game statistics?
  * I am planning on getting my data from stats.nba.com
  * There are other data sets with things like player movement and have more features than just box score stats.  I would need to check those for their methodology in coming up with the other features.
  * I chose this topic because I have been playing/watching basketball my whole life and I have always been interested in NBA statistics and how they can be leveraged to learn more about the game.
4. Does language associated with graduation on social media have a relationship with graduation rates in those areas?
  * I got my data from AT&T's Data for Diplomas competition data set (2015).
  * The graduation rates and census merged data set has about 550 features.
  * I chose this topic because I am interested in finding factors that influence graduation rates.
5. Predicting "good" lendingclub loan entries based off of historical observations of which loans were paid off/defaulted/and the yield.
  * Lendingclub has historical data on all loans that they have recorded.
  * There is historical data as well as data on loans that were declined by lendingclub.
  * I chose this topic because my brother is starting to get into lendingclub loans and want to see if we can make a model that will aid in the investment process.
